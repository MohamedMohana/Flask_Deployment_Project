# Flask API Deployment with Kubernetes

This repository showcases the deployment of a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster leveraging Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild. The Flask application in this project serves as an example of containerization and cloud deployment.

In this project you will containerize and deploy a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.

The Flask app that will be used for this project consists of a simple API with three endpoints:

- `GET '/'`: Endpoint for a basic health check returning 'Healthy'. 
- `POST '/auth'`: Accepts email and password in JSON format and provides a JWT token in response.
- `GET '/contents'`: Retrieves the payload of a valid JWT token. 

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.

## Initial setup
1. Fork this project to your Github account.
2. Locally clone your forked version to begin working on the project.

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine
    - Installation instructions for all OSes can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
    - For Mac users, if you have no previous Docker Toolbox installation, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac. If you already have a Docker Toolbox installation, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) before installing.
 - AWS Account
     - You can create an AWS account by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/#).
     
## Project Steps

Completing the project involves several steps:

1. Write a Dockerfile for a simple Flask API
2. Build and test the container locally
3. Create an EKS cluster
4. Store a secret using AWS Parameter Store
5. Create a CodePipeline pipeline triggered by GitHub checkins
6. Create a CodeBuild stage which will build, test, and deploy your code

For more detail about each of these steps, see the project lesson [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/1d842ebf-5b10-4749-9e5e-ef28fe98f173/modules/ac13842f-c841-4c1a-b284-b47899f4613d/lessons/becb2dac-c108-4143-8f6c-11b30413e28d/concepts/092cdb35-28f7-4145-b6e6-6278b8dd7527).
